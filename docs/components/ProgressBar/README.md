## Props

<div style="font-size: 0.8125rem">

## Best practices

Progress bar components should:

- Give merchants an indication of how much of the task has completed and how much is left.
- Not be used for entire page loads. In this case, use the [Skeleton page](/components/SkeletonPage) component.

## Related components

- For tasks with a short load time, use the [Spinner](/components/Spinner) component
- For full page loads, use the [Skeleton page](/components/SkeletonPage) component
